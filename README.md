# Website

A fully responsive personal website developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to provide an engaging and intuitive user experience across all devices.
This project demonstrates my front-end development skills, including responsive design, semantic markup, and interactive elements.
It also serves as a portfolio platform where I showcase my projects, skills, and contact information, reflecting my growth as a developer.
